Similiar to other ASPIDA program on my profile, but this one grabs wayyy more data from the computer and displays it using python.

It uses tkinter for Python code so if you dont have it installed you can just open .txt file, it will say where it was saved(also make sure to remove the last line of .bat file if you do not wish to use python part of this code).
